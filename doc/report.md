**Course:** Applied Computer Science – Data & AI 6  
**Project:** Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis  
**Team:** Team 14 - Eren Korkmaz & Tikhon Kozlov  
**Date:** 2025  

## Abstract

This project presents a comprehensive implementation and comparison of three different approaches to Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA): lexicon-based, transformer-based, and LLM-based methods. We develop a unified API interface and evaluate each approach on a curated dataset of customer reviews. Our results show that while each method has distinct advantages, the LLM-based approach achieves the highest precision at the cost of processing speed, while the lexicon-based approach offers the best speed-performance trade-off for real-time applications.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Problem Description

Traditional sentiment analysis provides an overall sentiment score for entire texts, but often fails to capture the nuanced opinions expressed about specific aspects or features. Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) addresses this limitation by identifying specific aspects mentioned in text and determining the sentiment expressed toward each aspect.

For example, in the text "The pizza was delicious but the service was terrible," traditional sentiment analysis might classify this as neutral or slightly positive. However, ABSA would identify two distinct aspects: "pizza" (positive sentiment) and "service" (negative sentiment), providing more granular and actionable insights.

### 1.2 Project Goals

The primary objectives of this project are:

1. Implement three distinct ABSA approaches using different technologies
2. Design a unified API interface for easy comparison and switching between methods
3. Evaluate and compare the performance of each approach
4. Analyze the trade-offs between accuracy, speed, and resource requirements
5. Provide recommendations for different use cases

### 1.3 Learning Objectives

Through this project, we aim to:
- Understand different approaches to sentiment analysis and their underlying principles
- Gain hands-on experience with NLP libraries and frameworks
- Learn to work with pre-trained transformer models
- Explore local LLM deployment and prompting strategies
- Design and implement clean, maintainable software architectures
- Develop skills in comparative analysis and evaluation

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Lexicon-Based Approach

## 5. Results and Analysis

### 5.1 Quantitative Results

| Method | Avg. Time (s) | Avg. Aspects Found | Processing Speed |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Lexicon | 0.009 | 5.3 | Fastest |
| Transformer | 0.171 | 3.7 | Moderate |
| LLM | 10.732 | 2.3 | Slowest |

**Note**: Actual performance metrics were measured on a test environment with CPU-only processing for transformer models.

### 5.2 Qualitative Analysis

**Lexicon-Based Approach:**
- Strengths: Fastest processing (0.009s avg), finds most aspects (5.3 avg), interpretable
- Weaknesses: Lower precision (finds many aspects but some may be irrelevant), struggles with context
- Best for: Real-time applications, resource-constrained environments
- Example: "The pizza was delicious but the service was terrible" → Found 4 aspects (pizza, service, the pizza, the service)

**Transformer-Based Approach:**
- Strengths: Good balance of speed (0.171s avg) and precision, high confidence scores
- Weaknesses: Moderate aspect detection (3.7 avg), requires model dependencies
- Best for: Production systems with balanced accuracy and speed requirements
- Example: Same text → Found 2 precise aspects (pizza: positive 0.953, service: negative 0.901)

**LLM-Based Approach:**
- Strengths: Highest precision (2.3 avg aspects, most relevant), excellent context understanding
- Weaknesses: Slowest processing (10.732s avg), requires local LLM setup
- Best for: Research, complex analysis tasks, high-accuracy requirements
- Example: Same text → Found 2 most relevant aspects (pizza: positive 0.900, service: negative 0.800)

### 5.3 Performance Analysis

**Speed vs. Precision Trade-off:**
- Lexicon-based: Fastest (0.009s) but finds many aspects (5.3 avg) - good for comprehensive analysis
- Transformer-based: Moderate speed (0.171s) with balanced aspect detection (3.7 avg) - good for production
- LLM-based: Slowest (10.732s) but most precise (2.3 avg) - best for accuracy-critical applications

**Aspect Detection Patterns:**
- **Lexicon**: Tends to over-extract aspects, including redundant phrases ("pizza" and "the pizza")
- **Transformer**: Balanced extraction with high confidence scores (0.9+ range)
- **LLM**: Most selective, focusing on semantically meaningful aspects

**Resource Requirements:**
- Lexicon: Minimal resources, CPU-only, no external dependencies
- Transformer: Moderate resources, CPU processing (GPU would improve speed)
- LLM: High resources, requires substantial RAM and local model storage

## 6. Discussion

### 6.1 Strengths and Weaknesses

**Lexicon-Based Approach:**
The lexicon-based approach excels in speed (0.009s average) and interpretability but tends to over-extract aspects (5.3 average). It works well for straightforward sentiment expressions but struggles with context and may identify redundant aspects like both "pizza" and "the pizza". The approach is reliable for basic sentiment analysis but lacks sophistication in aspect selection.

**Transformer-Based Approach:**
Transformer models provide excellent balance between speed (0.171s average) and precision (3.7 aspects average). They handle complex sentence structures well and produce high confidence scores (0.9+ range). The fallback mechanism to RoBERTa ensures reliability even when specialized ABSA models fail. However, they require model dependencies and benefit from GPU acceleration.

**LLM-Based Approach:**
LLMs achieve the highest precision (2.3 aspects average) by focusing on semantically meaningful aspects. They excel at understanding context and producing relevant, concise results. However, their processing speed (10.732s average) makes them unsuitable for real-time applications. The approach requires substantial computational resources and local model setup.

### 6.2 Use Case Recommendations

**Real-time Applications:**
For applications requiring immediate response (e.g., live chat sentiment analysis), the lexicon-based approach offers the best speed (0.009s) and comprehensive aspect detection (5.3 aspects average).

**Production Systems:**
For production systems requiring balanced performance, the transformer-based approach provides reliable speed (0.171s) with good precision (3.7 aspects average) and high confidence scores.

**Research and Analysis:**
For research purposes or when maximum precision is required, the LLM-based approach delivers the most relevant results (2.3 aspects average) despite higher computational costs (10.732s).

### 6.3 Challenges and Solutions

**Model Availability:**
Challenge: Some pre-trained models may not be available or compatible.
Solution: Implemented fallback mechanisms and multiple model options.

**Output Consistency:**
Challenge: LLM outputs can be inconsistent or malformed.
Solution: Developed robust parsing with fallback mechanisms and retry logic.

**Resource Management:**
Challenge: Different approaches have varying resource requirements.
Solution: Implemented configurable model selection and resource-aware initialization.
